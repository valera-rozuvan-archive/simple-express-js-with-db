#A simple setup of Express.js and NeDB

This is a simple project to demonstrate the following concepts and
technologies:

- [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) Embedded persistent database
for Node.js
- [REST API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) for
[CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations
on user data
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) HTML enhanced for web apps - user
interface

This project serves as an example, and shouldn't be used `as is` in a
production environment. Now that you have been warned, let's get started = )
